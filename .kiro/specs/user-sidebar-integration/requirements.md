# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on enhancing the user experience by integrating the user sidebar component into the main application layout and implementing proper redirection to the user dashboard upon successful authentication. The goal is to create a seamless navigation experience for authenticated users, ensuring they have access to their personalized dashboard and sidebar navigation immediately after signing in.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be automatically redirected to my dashboard after signing in, so that I can quickly access my personalized content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully completes the login process THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the user dashboard page.
2. WHEN a user registers for a new account THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the user dashboard page after successful registration.
3. IF a user attempts to access protected user routes without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a personalized sidebar with my information when I'm logged in, so that I can easily navigate through my account sections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display the user sidebar with the user's name and email.
2. WHEN a user navigates to any page under the /user/* route THEN the system SHALL maintain the user sidebar for consistent navigation.
3. IF a user's authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update the sidebar visibility and content accordingly.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the user sidebar integration to be modular and reusable, so that it can be easily maintained and extended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the user sidebar THEN the system SHALL use props to pass user data from the authentication context.
2. WHEN the sidebar is integrated into the layout THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design across different screen sizes.
3. IF the authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update all relevant components without requiring a full page reload.
